This App is a solution of a mobile Application that allows registered customers of Utibu health to make orders for their medication and also check their statements. This solution allows the pharmacist to maintain the current legacy database and system while also handle face to face sales. Online orders will appear in the database as well. Stable patients can be given medication to last several months without having to return for a doctorâ€™s visit. They can also refill their prescriptions at the pharmacy without having to see a doctor. The pharmacist at Utibu health has an inventory system that manages the stock of medication items, customer orders, sales, invoices and payments. It runs on Microsoft SQL Server and on a legacy desktop application. 

The pharmacist wishes that their clients are able to make orders for their medication remotely from a mobile app and if an order is successful, based on the level of stock in the pharmacy in the current database, indicate to the client that it has been confirmed. Then the client visits the health facility to pick their medication or can have the medication sent to them. The client may pay immediately or choose to pay later at the point of collection/receipt of their medication.
